# Capstone-Project

## Purpose
This repository serves as the center for my DS 4010 Capstone Project. It will contain my data, any code that cleans or analyzes the data, and my project dashboard. The purpose of my DS 4010 Capstone Project is to showcase the skills I have learned and developed over the course of my undergraduate degree. These skills include data cleaning, model building, data visualization, and presentation of results. My repository will be shared with future DS 4010 students, and will be put in my portfolio to showcase my skills to future employers.

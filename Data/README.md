### The data files are stored in the data/ directory and are organized as follows:

data/raw/: Contains the original, unprocessed data files split into 13 parts due to upload size restrictions

data/processed/: Contains the clean and transformed data. This data will potentially be split into parts as well depending on whether the data will be sized down throughout data processing.
